# Spaceships_game

This project is a space invader like game built with the pygame framework. 
It's been set following the tutorial of Tech with Tim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM).

The main goal was for me to learn how to use the framework and practice several topics & tools, such as git, Vs Code or POO.
